# phonecat-angularjs_cordova_init

Introduction

This project is completely implemented using Microsoft Apache Cordova with AngularJS. All codes are modified from AngularJS Tutorial (https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) and data are also from this tutorial. This project has been fully tested in Visual Studio 2015 (PRE) and Ripple - Nexus (Galaxy), as well as Emulators. The project contains full features of AngularJS Tutorial except "Animation". The project published here is for the purpose of learning to develop cross-device mobile applications by using AngularJS and Microsoft Apache Cordova. 

System Requirements

After you install Visual Studio 2015 (PRE), you should install Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/cordova-vs.aspx). They two tegether should resolve all dependency requirements. After finish above two steps, you can check out this project. No extra settings are needed. You can start play around using Ripple, or any Emulators. I haven't got time to deploy this project to real devices.

Feature Introduction and Note

The project contains most basic AngularJS features, dependency injection, multiple view routing, data binding, event handling, RESTful API call, low level $http calls etc.

I will add "animation" to the project. And will add "true" Cordova features like accessing native devices etc.

Happy Learning!
